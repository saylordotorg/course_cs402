**Unit 1: Networking Fundamentals** <span id="1"></span> 
*When you think of networking, what is the first word that comes to
mind? If you answered “Internet,” you are correct. The Internet is an
example of a massive computer network. Computer networks make it
possible for one device to communicate with another device. Another
example of a computer network is the local area network, or LAN. If you
can access all of the desktops, laptops, wireless devices, and printers
in your workplace, college, or home, you have a LAN.*  
    
 *This unit will introduce the basic concept of a computer network and
arm you with the tools you will need to work through the more technical
aspects of this course. You will take a look at the different types of
networks that exist, with the primary focus on the LAN. The unit
continues with an introduction to the concept of layers, which is
central to understanding how computer networks operate. You will also
become familiar with Request for Comments (RFC) documents, which are
standards that define all of the Internet protocols. RFCs are created
by* [*The Internet Engineering Task Force
(IETF)*](http://www.ietf.org/)*.*  
    
 *The concepts presented in this course will provide you with the
background information needed to develop network applications, take a
network certification course, or communicate with other networks
neighboring your LAN.*

     Instructions: Read the introduction to Chapter 2 and section 2.1,
    “Services and Protocols,” on pages 5–20. You may notice that some
    information in the textbook is not completely up-to-date. The
    Wikipedia article below includes some more recent information for
    you to explore. Also, Figure 2.1 in the textbook shows the number of
    hosts on the Internet only through 2007. Updated information is
    available at: <https://www.isc.org/solutions/survey/history>.  
        
     The second chapter of *Networking: Principles, Protocols, and
    Practice* serves as an introduction to networking as you link across
    time to review the development of standards and technologies that
    comprise today’s wired and wireless information systems entangled in
    the Web.  
        
     As you read this section, consider the following questions: What is
    the difference between a service and a protocol? What is topology
    and what is a transmission mode? What is the purpose of each?  
      
     Reading this article and taking notes should take approximately 2
    hours.

    Instructions: If you choose to use this app, you will first need to
    download the version appropriate to your mobile device. Note that
    there are costs associated with both of these apps, which is why
    they are optional. No quiz or exam questions will be derived from
    material within, but they are still useful supplementary resources.

    Once downloaded, open the Networking app and read the tutorials,
    “Networking Introduction,” “Network Topology I,” “Network Topology
    II,” and “Types of Networks.” Once you have a firm grasp of the
    material, quiz yourself with the “Networking Basics” and “Networking
    Topology and Hardware” flashcards, and take the “Network Topology”
    quiz. Retake the quiz as needed until you fully understand all of
    the concepts.

    Models”](http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Computer-Networking-Principles-Bonaventure-1-30-31-OTC1.pdf) (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read the introduction to section 2.2 and section
    2.2.1, “The reference models,” on pages 20–23. As you read, consider
    how we use layers as a model for describing network processing.
    Layers are the foundation for studying computer networks. You must
    understand how to work with layers to be able to describe the flow
    of a data request to its destination, and how the reverse occurs
    when the destination sends a response.  
        
     Reading these textbook sections and taking notes should take
    approximately 1 hour.
