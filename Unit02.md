**Unit 2: Networking Fundamentals: Protocols** <span id="2"></span> 

*In life, protocols define the way we interact with other people – for
example, the way we behave in a public place. In computer science,
protocols are formal sets of rules that dictate the ways in which
computers communicate with one another over a network medium. Protocols
constitute the backbone of networking. The standard model for networking
protocols and distributed applications is the International Standard
Organization’s Open System Interconnect (ISO/OSI) model. The Internet
protocol stack TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)
model presents a group of protocols optimized for inter-computer
communications and in particular for communications between multiple
applications that may run on one computer. This unit provides an
overview of the TCP/IP stack and its different layers, identifies the
function of each layer, introduces the basics of how computers talk to
one another in cyberspace using TCP/IP protocols, describes the
techniques for wide area networks, and discusses common transmission
media for the Internet.*

Upon successful completion of this unit, you will be able to:  
-   differentiate between the protocols in the TCP/IP model;
-   list and describe each of the layers in the OSI model;
-   compare and contrast each layer in the TCP/IP model with those in
    the OSI model;
