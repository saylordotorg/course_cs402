     **Note**: This exam has been designed as a *practice exam* for the
    credit bearing Thomas Edison State College **Network Technology
    (CMP-354-TE)** TECEP exam. You can register for that
    exam **[here](http://www2.tesc.edu/tecep.php?CourseCode=CMP-354)**.
    Please note that unlike The Saylor Foundation practice exam for this
    course, which is free, the TECEP exam will cost **$102.00. **Passing
    that exam will earn students **3 hours** of college credit, which
    can be applied to a Thomas Edison State College degree program, or
    potentially transfered to another college.  
      
     *If you choose to take the TECEP exam, upon completion you will be
    prompted to take a short survey. We encourage that you take the time
    to fill this out, as it will allow you to tell Thomas Edison State
    College that you used Saylor materials to prepare for their exam.
    This information can be useful in encouraging the development of
    additional TECEP exams and credit opportunities aligned to Saylor
    courses.*
